The mutant:
1. Adds an enable input signal (realistic control signal that should be there)
2. Fails to use it to gate the adder operation (the bug)
3. Maintains the same core functionality but now wastes power when enable=0
4. Keeps the same interface except for the added enable signal (which is realistic)
5. The code remains valid and compilable Verilog

MUTANT VERILOG BEGIN
module adder_8bit(

    wire signed [7:0] b_signed = b;
    assign {cout, sum} = a_signed + b_signed + cin;  // Signed inputs but unsigned addition
endmodule
MUTANT VERILOG END

The bug is introduced by:
1. Converting the inputs to signed wires
2. Performing unsigned addition on potentially signed values (the addition operation remains unsigned by default)
3. This creates a mismatch where the inputs could be interpreted as signed numbers but the addition is performed as unsigned, which would give incorrect results for negative numbers

[2025-08-13 21:45:30] [INFO] Response: Here's the mutant version with the count overflow bug introduced:

MUTANT VERILOG BEGIN
module counter_4bit(
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input enable,
    output reg [3:0] count
);
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            count <= 4'b0000;
        else if (enable)
            count <= count + 1'b1; // No overflow check - will wrap around from 1111 to 0000
    end
endmodule
MUTANT VERILOG END

The mutant removes any overflow protection that might have been intended (though not present in the original code either). The counter will now wrap around from 15 (4'b1111) to 0 (4'b0000) when incremented, which could cause unexpected behavior in systems that rely on the counter maintaining its maximum value. This is a realistic bug as many designs require counters to saturate at their maximum value rather than wrap around.

The bug was introduced by:
1. Changing "else if (enable)" to just "if (enable)"
2. This creates a situation where when neither reset nor enable is active, the count register will infer a latch because its value isn't explicitly set in all possible branches
3. The code remains syntactically valid and compilable, but now has different behavior where the counter might not hold its value properly when enable is low and reset is not active

The bug introduced is:
1. Changed the sensitivity list from `@(*)` to `@(a or b)`

3. This creates a simulation mismatch where changes in `sel` won't trigger the always block in simulation, while synthesis tools would still infer the correct combinational logic

The mutant inverts the selection logic by checking for `!sel` instead of `sel`. This minimal change swaps the functionality so that:
- When sel=0, it selects b (instead of a)
- When sel=1, it selects a (instead of b)
The code remains valid and compilable while introducing the specified polarity error.
